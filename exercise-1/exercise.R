# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`

# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have

# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000

# Create a variable `max.puppies`, which is the nuber of puppies you can afford for $1K.
